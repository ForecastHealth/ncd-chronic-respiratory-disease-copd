# -v: Verbose mode (shows what's being transferred)
# --delete: Deletes files in DEST_DIR that do not exist in SOURCE_DIR.
#           This is crucial for removing obsolete files and directories.
# --exclude: Specifies patterns of files/directories to NOT touch.
#
# We are excluding the specific files and directories you requested to keep
# in the COPD project, as well as temporary/result files that shouldn't be copied.
