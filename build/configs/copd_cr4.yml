# Configuration for COPD CR4 Scenario
metadata:
  label: "Appendix 3 - CR4 Scenario"
  description: |
    Long-term management of COPD with inhaled bronchodilator maintenance therapy.
    This scenario exposes the parameters for the Ipratropium Inhaler intervention.
    This was the mapping for the CR4 Scenario in Appendix 3 simulations.
    Ipratropium Inhaler reduces the disability weight of persons living with COPD by 16.9%, providing long-acting bronchodilation for maintenance therapy.
    This intervention targets 21% of the COPD population who require ongoing bronchodilator therapy for symptom management and prevention of exacerbations.
    The intervention maintains its baseline coverage of five percent in this scenario.
    This should typically be run as a comparison scenario, with the baseline scenario being the COPD Baseline, or modified versions with different target coverage levels for long-term COPD management strategies.
