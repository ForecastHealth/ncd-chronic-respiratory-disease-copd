# Configuration for COPD Null Scenario
metadata:
  label: "COPD - Null Scenario"
  description: |
    Scenario with all interventions scaled to 0% coverage, representing no intervention implementation.
    This null scenario sets target coverage to zero for all COPD-specific interventions: Inhaled Salbutamol, Ipratropium Inhaler, and Oral Prednisolone.
    Also sets coverage to zero for all tobacco control interventions including protection policies, cessation programs, warning labels, mass media campaigns, and advertising bans.
    This scenario serves as a counterfactual baseline to measure the full impact of intervention packages by comparing against a state with no interventions.
    Useful for calculating total health gains, deaths averted, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) prevented when interventions are implemented from zero coverage.
