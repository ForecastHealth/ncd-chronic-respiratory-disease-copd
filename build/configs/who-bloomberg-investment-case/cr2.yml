# Configuration for COPD CR2 Scenario
metadata:
  label: "Appendix 3 - CR2 Scenario"
  description: |
    Acute treatment of COPD exacerbations with inhaled bronchodilators and oral steroids.
    This scenario exposes the parameters for the Inhaled Salbutamol and Oral Prednisolone interventions.
    This was the mapping for the CR2 Scenario in Appendix 3 simulations.
    Inhaled Salbutamol reduces the disability weight of persons living with COPD by 14.8%, providing bronchodilation for symptom relief.
    Oral Prednisolone reduces the disability weight by 33.7% for severe COPD exacerbations, targeting 12% of the COPD population who experience acute worsening.
    Both interventions maintain their baseline coverage of five percent in this scenario.
    This should typically be run as a comparison scenario, with the baseline scenario being the COPD Baseline, or modified versions with different target coverage levels for acute treatment protocols.
